# Jacdac-Proto-Board
A protoboard for Jacdac plug-and-play for microcontrollers

The goal of this project ia to create a custom protoboard with built-in support for Jacdac plug-and-play for microcontrollers. This custom protoboard allows the makers to prototype their ideas for Jacdac ecosystem.

## Features

  1. Jacdac Connectors x 2
  2. (5 x 12) connection pins x 1
  3. (1 x 12) Power rails x 1
  4. [Footprint for 3.5mm Stereo Jack (SJ1-3513)](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/SJ1-3513/738683) x 2
  5. 3-Pin headers for Jacdac connectors x 2
  6. 1-Pin headers for 3.5mm Stereo Jack x 2
